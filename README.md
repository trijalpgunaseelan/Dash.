**Overview**

Dash is a unified iOS productivity platform designed to streamline task management, note-taking, project tracking, and GitHub repository access into a single, secure application. Built with Swift using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture, Dash leverages iOS-native features such as Face ID authentication, CoreData/Realm storage, and GitHub API integration to improve workflow efficiency for students, freelancers, and developers.

By consolidating essential productivity tools into one application, Dash eliminates workflow fragmentation and enhances organization, task tracking, and project oversight.
